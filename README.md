# Healthcare_Management_Analysis
A SQL Server database project for hospital management that includes tables, stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions.

---

🏥 Healthcare Management

A well-organized and normalized database system built using SQL Server, simulating essential features of a hospital management application. It incorporates table schemas, test data, stored procedures, views, triggers, and functions to support operations such as patient registration, doctor allocation, and report generation.

---

📌 Project Summary

This project was created for the Advanced Database Management Systems course to demonstrate practical implementation of relational databases using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). It showcases how databases can optimize hospital workflows while maintaining integrity, security, and ease of access.

🎯 Project Goals

📊 Structure a normalized database to handle hospital operations.

🛠️ Develop SQL scripts to define tables, relationships, and initial data.

🔄 Create reusable stored procedures for handling patients, doctors, and appointments.

🔍 Build views for simplified reporting and data retrieval.

🔔 Use triggers to enforce business logic and automate responses.

🧠 Implement user-defined functions for modular, repeatable logic.
